# jk.dusz.tarping

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `jk.dusz.tarping` is to contain the all the R code I used to clean, explore, and analyse the data from the 2020 managers' survey on the use of tarping/covering as a control method for Japanese knotweed *s.l.* (*Reynoutria spp*) launched by Marie-Anne Dusz *et al.* (INRAE, France).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `jk.dusz.tarping` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mrelnoob/jk.dusz.tarping")
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: I WILL CHANGE IT AFTER§§§§

```{r example}
library(jk.dusz.tarping)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
